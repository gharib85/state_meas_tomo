Instructions for running load_data.py
-------------------------------------

load_data.py is a copy of the script load_simulations.py written by Charles
Baldwin, with changes made in order to run the joint state-meas tomogrpahy code
on histogram data given to us by the trapped-ion group.

The script is currently setup to import the first (of three as of 11/7/2017)
data set: a collection of .csv files in the folder 2017-10-23--18.28.26.168.

To run script:
--------------

1. In lines 12-16, update sys.path.append commands as per instructions in
   Charles's README file
   
2. Comment out uses of MATLAB engine for expectation value bounding: lines
   176-178 in load_data.py and line 27 in analysis.py
   
3. Comment out lines 949-953 in analysis.py. (I had to do this in order for the
   script to run, due to a bug in the print message when there are multiple
   bootstrap confidence intervals)
   
--------------

The script when successfully run should return the following:

Running Tomography...
Running Bootstrap...
Bootstrap mean 0.3958911589252705
Elapsed Time: 27.41344690322876 seconds

Issues
-------

Output state fidelities with respect to target are very low, in the range of
0.2 to 0.5. I haven't found the problem yet as of this writing
